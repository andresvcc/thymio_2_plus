- **Interactive Programming Interface:** Offers a user-friendly programming interface that is suitable for all ages, making it straightforward to create, modify, and execute robot programming tasks.
- **Customizable Robot Settings:** Users can customize robot settings directly from their Android device, providing a flexible and personalized educational tool.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides real-time feedback and diagnostics to monitor robot performance and identify any issues during operation.

#### System Requirements

- **Compatible Devices:** Optimized for Android tablets.
- **Android Version:** Requires Android 10.0 or later.
- **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi capability necessary for connecting with the Thymio2+ dongle.

### Getting Started

#### Installation and Setup

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Thymio Suite app on an Android device. Follow these steps to ensure your development environment is ready and to run the app on an Android simulator or a physical device.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js (v18 or later) is installed.
2. **Java JDK**: Install Java Development Kit (JDK 11 is recommended).
3. **Android Studio**: Install Android Studio which will also install the latest Android SDK. During installation, make sure to include the Android Virtual Device (AVD) to emulate Android devices.
4. **Environment Variables**:
    - Set `JAVA_HOME` to your JDK path.
    - Set `ANDROID_HOME` to your Android SDK location, typically `~/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS or `C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` on Windows.

#### Step 1: Install Yarn

Install Yarn globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

#### Step 2: Go to the project folder

```bash
cd apps/thymio-suite-mobile-android
```

Run the following command in the project root directory to install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Android Development Environment

1. **Open Android Studio** and open your project by selecting the `android` folder within your project directory.
2. **Check for SDK Updates**: In Android Studio, open the SDK Manager and ensure the required SDK platforms and tools are installed for the Android version you are targeting.
3. **Create a Virtual Device**: If you don’t have a physical device, set up an AVD via Android Studio's AVD Manager.

#### Step 4: Prepare the Android Device

- **Physical Device**: Enable Developer options and USB debugging on your Android device.
- **Emulator**: Launch your AVD from Android Studio’s AVD Manager.

#### Step 5: Run the App

With your Android device ready and connected (or an emulator running), execute the following commands:

1. Start the Metro bundler in a separate terminal window:

```bash
yarn start
```

2. Run the app on Android:

```bash
yarn android
```

This command should install the app on the connected Android device or running emulator.

#### Step 6: Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Build fails**: Check the build output for any errors. Common issues may relate to version incompatibilities or missing SDK tools.
- **App doesn’t connect to development server**: Ensure your device is on the same network as your development machine, and that the Metro bundler is running.
