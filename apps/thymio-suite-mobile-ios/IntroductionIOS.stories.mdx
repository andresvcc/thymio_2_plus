#### System Requirements

- **Compatible Devices:** Optimized for use on iOS tablets.
- **iOS Version:** Requires iOS 13.0 or later.
- **Connectivity:** Requires Wi-Fi connectivity to communicate with the Thymio2+ dongle.

### Getting Started

#### Why React Native?

By utilizing React Native, the Thymio Suite App ensures a smooth and consistent user experience across all iOS devices, maintaining high performance and quick setup times. React Native’s component-based architecture allows for agile development and easy updates, which means the app can quickly adapt to new educational challenges and feedback from users.

This documentation will guide you through installation, setup, and basic operations, providing all the information you need to integrate Thymio Suite into your educational environment effectively.


Setting up and installing a React Native application tailored for iOS, such as the Thymio Suite app, requires several steps, including the installation of dependencies, configuration of iOS-specific components like CocoaPods and Xcode settings, and running the app on an iOS simulator or a physical device. Here’s a step-by-step guide assuming you already have Node.js 18 installed on your system.

### Step 1: Install Yarn (if not already installed)
Yarn is a package manager that will help you manage the app’s dependencies efficiently. To install Yarn, you can use the following command:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

### Step 2: Go to the project folder
```bash
cd apps/thymio-suite-mobile-ios
```

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
Navigate to your project directory (where your `package.json` is located) and run:
```bash
yarn install
```

### Step 4: Install iOS-specific Dependencies
React Native projects for iOS require CocoaPods for managing native dependencies:
1. **Install CocoaPods** (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    sudo gem install cocoapods
    ```
2. Navigate to the iOS directory in your project and install the pod dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ios
    pod install
    cd ..
    ```

### Step 5: Configure Xcode
Before you can build the project, make sure Xcode is configured correctly:
1. **Open the workspace** in Xcode:
    ```bash
    open ios/thymio.xcworkspace
    ```
2. Go to **Xcode > Preferences > Accounts** and make sure your Apple ID is added and you’re part of a development team that has the necessary permissions.
3. Select the appropriate **development team** for the project target:
    - Select the project in the Project Navigator.
    - In the main panel, ensure your team is selected under "Signing & Capabilities".

### Step 6: Run the App
To run the app on an iOS simulator or a connected physical device:
1. **Start the Metro Bundler** separately by running:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
2. **Run the app on iOS**:
    - To run on a simulator, you can simply use:
        ```bash
        yarn ios
        ```
    - To run on a connected device, make sure your device is connected and trusted. Then select your device as the build target in Xcode and hit the 'Run' button or use:
        ```bash
        yarn ios --device "Device Name"
        ```

### Step 7: Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the setup or build process:
- Ensure all paths in Xcode are correct and that no files are missing.
- Verify that all dependencies in `package.json` are correctly installed.
- Check the console for any error messages that might provide more insight.
